Using the excuse of Ray Kurzweil's \textit{singularity} predictions, this essay 
assesses some of the limitations of current machine learning developments. Concerns 
about the actual process of developing a machine learning system and a few 
theoretical limitations grounded in recent research are exposed in order to 
argue against Kurzweil's predictions.
